# COSC101
Coursework done in COSC 101 (Intro to Computing I) at Colgate University Fall 17

## About
* hw_01 - General python excercises including building of a volcano
* hw_02 - Program 1 - game winner (loops and accumulators), program 2 - Earth distance (importing functions from other modules), program 3 - days later (writing multiple functions and putting them together)
* hw_03 - Manipulates digital images. Features include red-filter, increase contrast, negative, brightness, vertical flip, scroll, and more.
* hw_04 - Discount - returns sale price (max $100) of an item. Faresale - returns sale version of a table-input. Reverse guessing game - Computer guesses a number between 1-100 with help of user.
* hw_05 - Word program. Calculates word_frequencies in a file, compare word_frequencies between two files, finds most x common words in a file, finds most common words from a given list, these last 2 functions can also be used between multiple files.
* hw_06 - Has a user create a x length of code, and guess colors present in that code. Returns black or white pegs depending on their guesses.
* hw_07 - Islands - via recursion counts number of unique islands (denoted 'X') in a txt file. Maze - solves a path for a maze using recursion.
